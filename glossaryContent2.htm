    <tr><th>TERM</th><th>DEFINITION</th></tr>
    <tr><td>ANHYDRITE</td><td>Anhydrous calcium sulfate mineral. Gypsum without water of crystallization, and alters readily to gypsum. Slightly harder and less soluble than gypsum.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BED</td><td>A layer of sedimentary rocks or sediments bounded above and below by bedding surfaces.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>BENTONITE</td><td>Soft clay or greasy claystone
    composed largely of smectite formed by the chemical alteration of glassy
    volcanic ash in contact with water. Bentonite can commonly absorb large
    quantities of water accompanied by a large increase in volume.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CARBONACEOUS</td><td>Rock or sediment rich in carbon or
    organic matter.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CHALK</td><td>A soft, pure, earthy,
    fine-textured, usually white to light gray or buff marine limestone
    consisting almost wholly of calcite. It is porous, somewhat friable, and only
    slightly coherent.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CHERT</td><td>Hard, extremely dense or compact
    sedimentary rock consisting mainly of interlocking quartz crystals less than
    about 30 microns in diameter. It occurs mainly as nodes or concretions (chert
    nodules) in limestones and dolomites. Also known as flint.</td></tr>

    composed mainly of broken fragments derived from preexisting rocks or
    minerals that have been transported some distance from their origin.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CLAY</td><td>A naturally occurring material made
    up primarily of fine-grained minerals. As a particle-size term, generally
    considered to be particles below either 2 or 4 micrometers.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CLAYSTONE</td><td>Any of a number of indurated rock
    types in which clay-sized particles are dominant.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>COAL</td><td>A readily combustible rock
    containing more than 50% by weight and more than 70% by volume of

    induration of variously altered plant remains similar to those in peat.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CONCEALED CONTACT</td><td>Geologic contact that is obscured
    by vegetation, soil cover, or other material and is located on the basis of
    interpolation from distant outcrops.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CONGLOMERATE</td><td>Coarse-grained clastic sedimentary
    rock, composed of rounded to subangular fragments larger than 2 mm in
    diameter (granules, pebbles, cobbles, boulders) typically containing
    fine-grained particles (sand, silt, clay) in the interstices, and commonly
    cemented by calcium carbonate, iron oxide, silica, or hardened clay.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>CONTACT</td><td>Boundary between two identifiable,
    adjacent masses of rock. A surface in 3-D space that intersects the map
    horizon (Earth's surface) to form a line on the map.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DOLOMITE</td><td>A carbonate sedimentary rock of
    which more than 50% by weight or areal percentages is the mineral dolomite,
    or a limestone rich in magnesium carbonate; it is clearly associated and
    commonly interbedded with limestone, and usually represents a postdepositional
    replacement of limestone.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>EOLIAN</td><td>Pertaining to wind, especially said
    of deposits such as loess and dune sand, of sedimentary structures such as
    wind-formed ripple marks, or of erosion and deposition accomplished by the
    wind.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ESCARPMENT</td><td>A relatively straight, clifflike
    face or slope of considerable linear extent, breaking the general continuity
    of the land by separating surfaces lying at different levels such as a
    plateau.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FISSILE</td><td>Capable of being easily split along
    closely spaced planes; exhibiting fissility.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FRIABLE</td><td>Crumbling naturally or easily
    broken, pulverized, or reduced to powder, such as a soft or poorly-cemented
    sandstone.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GLACIER</td><td>Large ice mass formed at least
    partly on land by the compaction and recrystallization of snow, moving slowly
    by gravitational creep, and surviving from year to year.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GRAVEL</td><td>An unconsolidated, natural
    accumulation of typically rounded rock fragments resulting from erosion,
    consisting mainly of particles larger than sand (diameter greater than 2 mm),
    such as boulders, cobbles, pebbles, granules, or any combination; the unconsolidated
    equivalent of conglomerate.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GYPSUM</td><td>Mineral consisting of aquated
    calcium sulfate. It is the commonest sulfate mineral and can form thick,
    extensive beds interstratified with limestone, shale, and clay.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>INDURATED</td><td>Describing a rock or soil hardened
    or consolidated by pressure, cementation, or heat.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>KAOLINITIC</td><td>Made up of kaolin clay minerals,
    which have lower base-exchange capabilities and absorb less water than other
    clays. Kaolinitic clays do not appreciable expand under increased water
    content.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>KIMBERLITE</td><td>Found in a small area in Riley and
    Marshall counties, kimberlites are igneous rock composed of at least 35%
    olivine, together with other minerals such as mica, serpentine, and calcite.
    They are forced to the surface through kimberlite 'pipes,' due to melting of
    olivine-rich peridotite in the Earth's mantle that is then forced upward due
    to lower temperature and pressure. Diamonds may be found in kimberlites,
    though there is no evidence of diamonds in Kansas kimberlites.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>LAMPROITE</td><td>Lamproites have been found in
    Kansas at two sites in Woodson County. Lamproites are similar to kimberlites, but have a different chemical
    composition. Like kimberlites,
    the rock itself is called peridotite, and is high in the minerals olivine and
    pyroxene. Though diamonds can
    also occur in lamproites, none have been found in Kansas.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>LENTICULAR</td><td>Resembling the cross section of a
    lens in shape. The term may be applied, for example, to a body of rock, a
    sedimentary structure, or a mineral habit.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>LIGNITE</td><td>Brownish-black coal intermediate in
    coalification between peat and subbituminous coal.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>LIMESTONE</td><td>A carbonate sedimentary rock
    containing more than 95% calcite and less than 5% dolomite. Formed by biotic

    one-millionth of a meter. One inch equals 25,400 micrometers.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MORTAR BED</td><td>Deposit consisting of sand or of a
    mix of clay, silt, sand, and gravel, firmly cemented by calcium carbonate and
    resembling hardened mortar. Also known as calcrete or caliche.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MUDSTONE</td><td>An indurated mud having the texture
    and composition of shale, but lacking its fine lamination or fissility; a
    block or massive fine-grained sedimentary rock in which the proportions of
    clay and silt are approximately equal; a nonfissile mud shale.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>OBSERVED CONTACT</td><td>Geologic contact that is located on
    the basis of direct outcrop observation and/or interpolation from nearby
    outcrops.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>OOLITIC</td><td>Pertaining to oolite, a sedimentary
    rock, usually a limestone, made up mainly of ooliths (a type of small, round
    or ovate accretionary body in a sedimentary rock, resembling fish roe and
    having diameters between 0.25 and 2 mm) cemented together.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>OUTCROP</td><td>The part of a geologic formation or
    structure appearing at the surface of the Earth.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SAND</td><td>Detrital rock fragment or mineral
    particles larger than a coarse silt grain and larger than a granule (62-2,000
    micrometers), or a loose aggregate of unlithified mineral or rock particles
    of sand size; and unconsolidated or moderately consolidated sedimentary
    deposit of mainly medium-sized clastics.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SANDSTONE</td><td>A medium-grained clastic
    sedimentary rock composed of abundant rounded or angular fragments of sand
    size with or without a fine-grained matrix of silt or clay, and more or less
    firmly united by a cementing material such as silica, iron oxide, or calcium carbonate;
    the consolidated equivalent of sand.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SELENITE</td><td>The clear, colorless variety of
    gypsum, occurring in distinct, transparent, monoclinic crystals or in large
    crystalline masses that easily cleave into broad folia.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SHALE</td><td>A laminated, indurated rock
    containing greater than 67% clay-sized minerals; a claystone with fissility.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SIDERITE</td><td>An iron carbonate mineral. Usually
    yellow-brown, brown-red, or brown-black in color, though occasionally white
    or gray. It is often found as beds or nodules in clays and shales.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SILT</td><td>Rock fragment or detrital particle
    larger than coarse clay and smaller than very fine sand (4-62 micrometers),
    or a loose aggregate of unlithified mineral or rock particles of silt size.
    Silt commonly has high clay mineral content in the finer fractions and and
    high quartz mineral content in the coarser fractions.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>SILTSTONE</td><td>An indurated silt with the texture
    and composition of shale but without its fine lamination or fissility; a
    massive mudstone in which silt predominates over clay; a nonfissile silt
    shale.</td></tr>
